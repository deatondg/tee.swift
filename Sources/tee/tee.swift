/**
 `tee` duplicates the data from `input` into each of the `outputs`.
 Generally, the arguments to `tee` should be `Pipe`s or `FileHandles` like the
    `standardInput`/`standardOutput`/`standardError` in `Process` from `Foundation`,
 The `fileHandleForReading` of `input` is used to gather data which is then wrriten to the `fileHandleForWriting` of the `outputs`.
 When the input sends an EOF (observed as a length 0 read), the handles of `input` and `outputs` are closed if their
    `teeShouldCloseForReadingOnEOF` or `shouldCloseForWritingOnEOF`properties respectively are `true`.
 `tee` sets the `readabilityHandler` of inputs and the `writeabilityHandler` of outputs, so you should not set these yourself after calling `tee`.
 The one exception to this guidance is that you can set the `readabilityHandler` of the input's handle to `nil` to stop `tee`ing.
 After doing so, the `writeabilityHandler`s of the outputs will be set to `nil` automatically after all in-progress writes complete,
    but if desired, you could set them to `nil` manually to cancel these writes although this may result in some outputs recieving less of the data than others.
 This implementation waits for all outputs to consume a piece of input before more input is read.
 This means that the speed at which your processes read data may be bottlenecked by the speed at which the slowest process reads data,
    but this method also comes with very little memory overhead and is easy to cancel.
 If this is unacceptable for your use case. you may wish to rewrite this with a data deque for each output.
 The `TeeReadable` and `TeeWriteable` types are defined below, followed by some convenience methods, then the non-variadic implementation of `tee`.
